Wordle is a game where your goal is to guess the 5-letter mystery word in six or less attempts. When you have entered a 5-letter word, and submitted the word, colors will appear on each word, indicating whether the letters are in the word and in the correct spot, in the word but in the incorrect spot, or its not in the word.
